# Introduction
Your basic laravel dashboard with all the required settings to manage your customers and very necessary accounting done with ability to create multiple domain 
implementations for frontend and not enable frontend at all.

# Code reusability - DONT REPEAT YOURSELF.
Wait! we are writing too many things on repetition and have accepted that as reality. Ex: Your regular day to day HTML forms. Writing static pages directly 
in your HTML from scratch. Or maybe you are using Wordpress a huge bloat of autoloaded container with lots of dirty security flaws that you don't know when
its day zero or face support outage in near future, for what writing static pages (SHAME!!!).

On severe analysis i found we are blocking our abilities (SUPERPOWERS!!!) to create great things on daily basis. Microservices is so difficult to make
because you feel no use case for it with your current approaches. But code reusabilty unlocks various possibilities in your IT evolution and verticals that we dreamt 
of to do actually.

Orca dashboard gives you plain basic customers, channels, sales features and OPENAPI ready for third party context usage such as your existing ERP/XERO/etc.
SAAS based approach also available. 

# Features:
    1. Customers
    2. Sales (Invoices/Orders).
    3. Manage customer and tie them to vertical type.
    4. Manage organization's core integrities.
    5. Use laravel blade for creating static pages.
    6. Headless CMS also will be made available shortly.
    7. Core attributes.
    8. Engage your customers directly via mails or notification channels such as SMS, etc. 
    
Orca is designed to help you in able ways to reuse code in a very possibly friendly manner. Its usage with AppStore is a total different perspective all together.
Binding Orca with AppStore will give you dependencies such as core system attributes push and pull to customers on the go.

# Now lets talk about attributes:
Digital information exists in two forms only:
1. Structured.
2. Unstructured.

Both existence are now possible in DB (In memory / SQL). Ex: MySQL, MongoDB, S3, local disk, etc.

Attributes is a core that an organization should rely on if we really wanna make services / apps should implement and then serve the customer verticals. And derive
customer requirements into flows.

Attributes are vivid when constructed they goes across our application via Arrays, JSON, DB records and OOP properties. Attributes can be used to make resources with
its own properties and provide CRUD API on the go.

# Attributes are important!

Attributes are your daily used language primitive types, composable type of service units whether stored in certain kind of memory system or get derived when 
required.

Just to manage resources and referential integrity we write schemas and views to make it usable as a service for end customers. While services which cannot 
be seen complete via attributes or are better implemented by someone such as AWS SNS/SQL/Redis/etc can be coupled in modules and packages and be used with appstore.

# Attributes are in development currently.
Attributes is a very complex topic to rely on. And it need many things apart from holding value for a resource. A resource attribute might be getting used across
your as a property that is end customer service centric. Or in simple words we need cross platform objects and attributes is a very very special way to achieve it.

Common attribute types:
1. String
2. Text
3. Boolean
4. Date
5. Datetime
6. JSON
7. Array
8. Composable
9. Link
10. Password
11. Email
12. etc.

Attributes in Orca are under progress with usage of JSON schemas we intend to test and deploy attributes to be used in resources. A generic attibute has these common
properties:
1. Visibility
2. Type
3. Render logic
4. Store logic
5. Required
6. Immutable (i18n)

Orca can create resource via attributes and via your own customer attribute implementation but gives us hybrid approach through which we can achieve code reusability.

Since a single admin panel is all you ever wanted to serve your customers its like your central command. That is able to manage very essential information across 
your services.
